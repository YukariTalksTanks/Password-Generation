The reason behind this program's creation is to further my studies during my Georgia Tech BootCamp, this one particularly intrested me since I like the idea of making a security interface and the like. It was really good practice, however I am still lacking in the ability to work around hard coding and combining outcomes and inputs properly. 
For this program I created a password generator from the outlines and README given for the task.
I look forward to more challenges and some good input from the grading system as to how I can better this program in the near future.
